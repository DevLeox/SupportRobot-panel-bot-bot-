Look, it is in Java itself
 a robot
 You go to the panel
 You enter your password
 And you run the source
 The menu opens and says the services
 1_ Making a robot
 2_ Delete the robot
 3_ Add or edit the command
 4_ Delete command
 The first time you hit 1
 It asks you for the name of the robot, you type it and it creates it
 It says the password and the name of the robot, which is stored in the e-mail
 Then you choose option 3
 And you enter a key for the command, for example, Hi, and then it asks you for a value, and in it, for example, Hi, How are you?  You enter and the order is saved
 Now press 4 to delete the command and press 2 if you want to delete the robot
 when you did everything ok

 You enter the main project
 There you enter your password and the name of the robot you want to talk to
 It says when you ran there
 What can this robot do?  : 
 I mean, what can this robot do?
 And I made it so that when you build the robot, a Jason named welcomeTXT is created and there is nothing in it
 You can write the characteristics of your robot in it
 Go to the panel and edit the wlecomeTXT command
 And then you talk to the robot, it will answer you according to the things stored in the robot, for example, what we have stored
 Hi
 The robot says what you say
 hi how are you
